# Soon here a Clojure dialect targeting Dart!

## Why ClojureDart?

To allow Clojure users to reach to native mobile and desktop apps through Flutter.

## Who is behind it?

Tensegritics, an itty-bitty Clojure consultancy by [Baptiste Dupuch](https://github.com/dupuchba) and [Christophe Grand](https://github.com/cgrand).

## How can I help?

Directly by sponsoring either of us here on GitHub.

Indirectly by hiring us.

## When will it be released?

Beta release before Easter 2022 (April 17) 🐇🔔🥚🍫.

There will be no repl but a watching compiler to go with Flutter (well DartVM) hot-reload.
